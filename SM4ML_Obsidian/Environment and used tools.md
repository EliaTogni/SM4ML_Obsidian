Prior to delving into the intricacies of different theoretical frameworks and implementation decisions, this section introduces the primary tools and environment utilized for running the developed code. These choices, in my assessment, are pertinent for executing the models and setting up experiments effectively.

# Libraries and Frameworks
The whole code has been written in a Google Colab environment, which provides Jupyter-notebook, a free notebook for Python$3$-code execution. I chose this environment because of its simplicity and intuitiveness, which made easier to code with multiple libraries.

Here I present a brief list of the main packages and libraries used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Numpy
\item Pandas
\item PIL
\item os
\item shutil
\item matplotlib
\item google.colab
\item sklearn
\item skimage
\item tensorflow
\item keras
\item gspread
\end{itemize}
