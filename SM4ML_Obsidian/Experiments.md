# Artificial Neural Networks
## An introduction to Artificial Neural Networks
**Neural networks** are a large and complex class of predictors applicable to a variety of fields, given their powerful capability in tasks like classification, regression, and sequence prediction. 

A Neural Network is usually depicted as a graph $G = \langle V , E \rangle$, where $V$ is the finite set of vertices or nodes and $E$ is the finite set of weighted edges. The vertices $v \in V$ are called **neurons** or units and the edges $e \in E$ are called **connections**.

Each neuron first computes the product of the weights of incoming edges with the corresponding incoming inputs and then applies an activation function over it.

I will only refer to and consider feed forward neural networks, that is, models in which there are no loops or cycles in the graph representation of the network. The term feed forward refers to the fact that the computation can be transmitted only along the directed connections and that the output of a layer becomes the input of the following one\\cite{Kruse}.

## Multi Layer Neural Networks
The simplest form of feedforward NN is the Multi Layer Neural Network, a class of artificial neural networks characterized by their layered architecture, consisting of multiple interconnected nodes organized into **input**, **hidden**, and **output** layers. 

in which the nodes of V can be partitioned in a sequence of layers such that each node of a layer has incoming edges only from nodes in the previous layer and outgoing edges only to nodes of the next layer. The layers containing the hidden nodes are called hidden layers.
